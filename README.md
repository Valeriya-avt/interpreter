Welcome!
Tired of fixing compiler errors? <br/>
Do you keep forgetting the semicolon? <br/>
Are you missing the capabilities of your favorite programming language? <br/><br/>

We will help you! Let's write an interpreter for our own programming language, and no one but us can give us errors.

### This interpreter can:
 * Read code from file;
 * Divide the code into tokens by creating an infix notation;
 * Build a postfix record based on an infix record;
 * Work with arithmetic operators;
 * Handle the assignment operator;
 * Work with logical operators;
 * Realize the work of the transport operator (goto);
 * Handle a conditional statement;
 * Work with a while cycle.
